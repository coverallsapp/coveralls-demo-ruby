# Configure your project for Coveralls & CircleCI

This project is configured to send test coverage results to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) using the [Coveralls Universal Reporter](https://github.com/coverallsapp/coverage-reporter). It does not use the [Coveralls Orb](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/coveralls/coveralls).
