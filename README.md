# Configure your project for Coveralls & Github Actions

This project is configured to send test coverage results to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) from [Github](https://github.com/) using the [coveralls-ruby](https://github.com/lemurheavy/coveralls-ruby) gem, without using the [Coveralls Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/coveralls-github-action).

See the [github-actions](https://github.com/coverallsapp/coveralls-demo-ruby/tree/github-actions) branch for an example using just the [Coveralls Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/coveralls-github-action). ([coveralls-ruby](https://github.com/lemurheavy/coveralls-ruby) gem not required.)
